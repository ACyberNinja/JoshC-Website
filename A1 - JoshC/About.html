		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<div class="content">
			<p>This is a website created by Josh Campbell. 
			I am an 18 year old student at Wintec studying to become an IT. 
			This Website contains the necessary information to contact me and view my <a href="Josh-Mark-Campbell-CV.pdf">CV</a>. 
			I've had an interest in the information technology industry since early into high school. 
			I am determined to get work done. 
			I am very respectful to others and slow to anger. 
			I always like to be prepared and early. 
			I always turn up, and if I am not able to turn up, I would notify before hand. 
			I am eager to learn. 
			I am able to work both independently and work as a team. 
			A lot of this info show ups on my <a href="Josh-Mark-Campbell-CV.pdf">CV</a> and is what I find to be the best parts of me for any employer to consider.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions feel free to <a href="Contacts.html">contact me.</a></p>
